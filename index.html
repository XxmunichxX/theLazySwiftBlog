    <h1>The Lazy Swift Blog</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>The Lazy Swift Blog</strong>, where we embrace the philosophy of laziness...
        the one coming from Swift!<br><br>
        Like lazy variables and lazy views, indeed, we believe in doing the right work, at the right 
        time, and only when it's truly needed. Because sometimes, the best way to get things done is to work smarter, not harder.
